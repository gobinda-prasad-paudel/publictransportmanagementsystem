# Public Transportation Management System (PTMS)

**PTMS** consists of both hardware components and software.

### **Bus Unit**: This unit is fitted on the bus.

|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| NFC Reader                                  | (Implemented)         |
| NFC Card (for payment, re-loadable)         | (Implemented)         |
| Display (To show payment status)            | (Implemented)         |

| ESP-32                                      | (Implemented)         |

### **Admin Unit**: This unit is used for enrolling NFC cards from the admin panel.

| Hardware Component                          | Implementation Status |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| NFC Reader                                  | (Implemented)         |
| NFC Card (for payment, re-loadable)         | (Implemented)         |
| Laptop                                      | (Implemented)         |
| Cable                                       | (Implemented)         |

### **Software**: There are two software applicationsâ€”one for customers and another for the admin panel. Due to time constraints, we were unable to completely develop both the web app (admin) and the mobile app (customers).

### **Highlighted Features**:

1. Driver can send an emergency **SOS** signal to the admin panel in case of fire, fighting, or any unusual incident.
2. Displays **remaining seats** on a particular bus.
3. Displays the **safety rating** of a particular bus.
4. Government authorities can monitor all activities of citizens.
5. Users can easily detach the **lost** card from the app.
6. Displays the **estimated time** for a bus to arrive at a particular bus stop.
7. Easy to **file a complaint** via the mobile app (if anything happens to you on the bus).
8. Easy to **report lost and found** items.
9. Allows users to **top up the card using a gift card**.

Customers can top up their transport card by scanning the QR code of a gift card (the design of the QR code is also provided in Figma).

We also have the Figma UI design for both the apps.
